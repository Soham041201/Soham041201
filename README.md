hi, i'm soham 👋

i'm a founding team engineer at [kily.ai](https://kily.ai), working across **full‑stack** systems, data pipelines, and llm‑powered products.previously, i’ve shipped production features at kodo, dukaan, and as the technical co‑founder of leazkart.

what i enjoy:
- designing simple, reliable systems that actually ship
- building internal tools, agents, and workflows around llms
- teaching, writing, and sharing how things work under the hood[web:18]
